This is a port of [ScalaPrimavera](https://github.com/cobaltolabs/ScalaPrimavera) for [Kotlin](http://jetbrains.com/kotlin). Same team, Same goals.

Right now the Kotlin compiler is a little buggy, but we hope that this will improve this year.

So, in this moment this project is a more academic project, to play and test the language but with a clear goal in mind

As far as the language and the tools evolve, we'll produce artifacts and other things, for now, you can check the code to see how the Kotlin language is.
